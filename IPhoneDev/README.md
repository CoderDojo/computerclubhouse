IPhone Development
===================

This course was requested by the group to teach them how to build
a simple application.  

We started the first few weeks through building mock applications to get
everyone use to using XCode.  This focused on the design and graphics side. 
During this time the we focused on 
* Backgrounds / colors
* All the widgets
* Simple navigation
* Images


The first application we are going to look at is a simple calculator, this 
application introduces the relationship between the screen widgets and the
code.
